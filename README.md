# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly chooses its move.  The game displays the outcome and keeps score across rounds.  Building this taught me how to generate random choices, compare values, and update the DOM based on user input.  Try playing by opening `index.html` in your browser.
